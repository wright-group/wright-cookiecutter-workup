# wright-cookiecutter-workup

A [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html) template for data analysis. 
Includes integration with [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/4znzp/) storage.
Includes a CLI for figure plotting (using click).

# Usage

1. If your are using OSF, start an OSF repository and establish an ID.
    You will want this ID before initializing the project.
    You need not push your data to the OSF repository right away.
2. Install cookiecutter.  
    Using conda:
    ```conda install cookiecutter```
3. Initialize the project folder. 
    Using a terminal in the parent folder for your project destination, run

    ```cookiecutter gh:wright-group/wright-cookiecutter-workup```

    and complete the prompts.
4. The project is now templated. You can begin working up data!  Now is also a good time to start a git repository.
